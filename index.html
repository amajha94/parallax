            <h2>YAHA KUCCH NAHI HAI</h2>
            <p>
                According to the Oxford English Dictionary, hello is an alteration of hallo, hollo,[1] which came from Old High German "halâ, holâ, 
                emphatic imperative of halôn, holôn to fetch, used especially in hailing a ferryman".[5] It also connects the development of hello to 
                the influence of an earlier form, holla, whose origin is in the French holà (roughly, 'whoa there!', from French là 'there').[6] As in 
                addition to hello, halloo,[7] hallo, hollo, hullo and (rarely) hillo also exist as variants or related words, the word can be spelt using
                any of all five vowels. Telephone Before the telephone, greetings often included a name and a time of day, such as "Good morning, 
                Doctor", but on the telephone, it isn't immediately known who is speaking or whether they share the same time zone. So greetings 
                without time began to catch on. [11]The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison; according to one 
                source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo.[12] Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a 
                telephone greeting.[13][14] However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T. B. A. David, president of the Central District and Printing 
                Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh: Friend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away. 
                What you think? Edison – P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.[12]
                By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' because of the association between the greeting and the telephone.[14][15]
                A 1918 fiction novel uses the spelling "Halloa" in the context of telephone conversations.[16]
Hullo, hallo, and other spellings
"Hallo" redirects here. For other uses, see Hallo (disambiguation).
Hello might be derived from an older spelling variant, hullo, which the American Merriam-Webster dictionary describes as a "chiefly British variant
 of hello",[17] and which was originally used as an exclamation to call attention, an expression of surprise, or a greeting. Hullo is found in 
 publications as early as 1803.[18] The word hullo is still in use, with the meaning hello.[19][20][21][22]
Hello is alternatively thought to come from the word hallo (1840) via hollo (also holla, holloa, halloo, halloa).[23] The definition of hollo is to shout or an exclamation originally shouted in a hunt when the quarry was spotted:[24][25]
If I fly, Marcius,/Halloo me like a hare.

— Coriolanus (I.viii.7), William Shakespeare
Fowler's has it that "hallo" is first recorded "as a shout to call attention" in 1864.[26] It is used by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's famous poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner written in 1798:

And the good south wind still blew behind,
But no sweet bird did follow,
Nor any day for food or play
Came to the mariners' hollo!
